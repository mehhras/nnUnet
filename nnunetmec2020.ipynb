It has set a new benchmark in the field of medical image segmentation. Whilst, the pipeline itself take of the hyperparameter tuning and requires no change in the network architecture, to achieve start-of-the-art results.\n",

Training the system of a colab notebook is again a challenge, as at require many manual steps.
